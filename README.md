# Store

This is a basic E-commerce type  project. I had used one third party library CHTCollectionViewWaterfallLayout to acheive the waterfall layout. Other than this no third party libraries were used.

No storyboards or xib were used. Everything in the project were achieved by Coding.

Multiple filters are available in this screen. Each applied filter gives the exact filtered data.

To avoid multiple fetch from the data i had used a switch case to get the data from the filtered value if any filter ares applied

CoreData is used as local DB to store and fetch data. If there no network the data from the CoreData will display

Every class, view, methods are reuseable and flexible for updation.

Here i maintained clear and readable coding architecture to achieve everything
